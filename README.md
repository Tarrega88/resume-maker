Resume-maker turned into Docu-Gen - it's essentially a UI for React PDF.

You can apply and save CSS styles, which can then be reused and copied across the entire document.

There's also an SVG editor that allows for an easy way to upload and edit characteristics of any SVGs you want on the document.

I learned a lot from doing this project, but I think as it stands it's a very powerful but CLUNKY interface. It's something I want to revisit because the idea of programmatically generating documents still sounds neat to me, but the whole UI/UX of this could be improved pretty massively.

The main strength to this tool is that it allows the saving/reuse of complete templates, and that includes both pure style templates and something more akin to a component template but for a PDF.

So, if you created a style that applied bold text, padding, and text centering and named it "centered bold" then you can reuse that later on in the same document anywhere directly through the UI.

It also allows for the movement of entire sections of the document. Say you have 3 columns, moving one to the right just involves tapping an arrow on the UI to the right.

So, overall a very powerful tool but admittedly it desperately needs some usability tweaks.

Check it out and give it a try if you know a bit of CSS.
